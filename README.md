# Lotto App

In this app the user gives their own lottery numbers and they are shown an estimated time (in years) in which
the jackpot is achieved. The app also shows how many years it took to get every other amount of numbers right.


## Customizability

The default lotto setting are:
* Values from 1 to 40
* 7 numbers per one row

Each of these values can be changed easily with only one change.
